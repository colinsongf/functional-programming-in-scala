Using foldRight, we cannot immediately halt recursion when we see a 0.0.
Using foldRight, our options are limited to modifying the argument function f, but
it's arguments are already traversed when the function is applied.

I.e. the statement f(x, foldRight(xs, fallBack)(f)) is 'written out', before
f is applied.
